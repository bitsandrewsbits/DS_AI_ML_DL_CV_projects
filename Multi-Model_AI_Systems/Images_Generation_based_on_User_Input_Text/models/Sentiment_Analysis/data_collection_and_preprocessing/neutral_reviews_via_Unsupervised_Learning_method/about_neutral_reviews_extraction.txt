# neutral reviews extraction via Unsupervised Learning method
# method - embedding-based clustering (via LLM):
# TODOs:
# 0) Text cleaning(nltk lib)

# 1) Store LLM(embeddinggemma from Google) on Ollama server
for generating embedding vectors:
  a) Docker compose file - for starting container with Ollama server in order to load
LLM model for embedding generation for unlabeled dataset(temp container)
  b) py-script for init Ollama client and load LLM to Ollama. After that generate
reviews texts embedding vectors and save it.
  c) Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction for reviews embedding vectors for more accurate clustering.

# 2) K-means algorithm for embeddings clustering - 3 classes(clusters)
